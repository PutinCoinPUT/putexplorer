NOTE: As of v1.100.0-bae4d50, it is no longer necessary to manually restart the explorer after updating, as long as you are using the built-in update script `npm run update-explorer`. All other manual updates such as `git pull` will still require a restart to the explorer after updating.

This should help prevent data anomalies when you need to stop or kill a sync process)

-The code to compile scss to css has been moved from the prestart script into its own compile_css.js script which is now called from the update-explorer.js script to apply css changes after update
-The cluster code now handles a custom restart msg which is used to restart the explorer from the update explorer process
-Pm2 and Forever are now referenced by the name 'explorer' instead of ./bin/instance or ./bin/cluster
-Added reload/restart scripts to the package.json for pm2 and forever
-Pm2 and forever now write a pid file to the tmp directory when started. NOTE: Forever is now started from the prestart script due to a bug in forever that prevents the pid from being written to a different directory without the absolute path
-Fixed a bug which caused the prestart script to be run twice when starting the explorer with `npm start`
-The cluster code now accepts a numeric argument to force a specific number of instances to be loaded

-Improved loading speed of the network page by combining 3 separate database calls into 1
-Added support for the Dex-Trade exchange
-Added support for the FreiExchange/FreiXLite exchange (this exchange has 2 separate sites using the same api, so new functionality was added to the explorer to handle alt markets like this with an alt market name, alt logo, market url and an "isAlt" function to determine if the alt name/logo should be used)
-Support was added for the getblockchaininfo rpc cmd which now allows the coin supply to be populated via this function
-The network difficulty chart now supports 2 datasets: POW and POS
-Fixed a bug with the network difficulty chart where it would fail to populate if the shared_pages.difficulty setting was 'Hybrid'
-NetworkHistory.difficulty field was renamed to difficulty_pow and a new difficulty_pos field was added

-Both dependencies and dev dependencies sections have been sorted alphabetically to help prevent auto package.json changes
-The custom user-agent strings for http requests have all been removed
-Fixed an issue with the crex24 market chart that could cause it to be overpopulated with data and therefore unreadable/unusable

1.100.0 [May 29, 2022]
-Added a custom.scss file that can be used to add custom css changes without affecting the ability to do a git pull update
-Added new update script to A) grab the latest code form github, B) update all dependencies, and C) run the database initialize function to ensure new changes take effect immidiately
-freegeoip.app now requires an api key so the peer sync has been updated to use reallyfreegeoip.org instead
-Added extra error checking to the peer sync so that it will error out when the geolocation service does not return a proper object
-Added locks to all sync processes (blocks, markets, peers, masternodes) as well as "create backup", "restore backup" and "delete database" functions. This helps prevent problems with syncing data while a backup is in progress for example
-The code to initialize certain database collections on startup was moved into database.js and is now called from restore_backup.js and delete_database.js. This effectively allows the database to be deleted or restored to a completely different backup while the explorer is still running

-is_locked function now accepts an array of lock files to be able to check for multiple locks in a single call

-Rewrote a number of internal scripts to allow for better cross-platform support (Windown, MacOS, Linux)
-Backup and Restore scripts now use mongo's own encryption instead of tar.gz by default. Older tar.gz backups can still be restored as long as the tar.gz suffix is explicitly added

-Added a link to exchange on markets page
-Added the current git commit id to end of explorer version

-Added some tweaks and improvements to the Reindex sync feature (Added an "Are you sure" prompt before starting the reindex, All necessary coin stat data is cleared before starting, More and better messages about what is being done during the process, Shifted some of the code around to be run in a better order)
-Added unique page titles for each individual page
-Added code to prevent caching of local css files
-Bootstrap was upgraded to latest version (v5.1.3) which required tons of changes to the UI. Many little UI problems have been resolved

-Removed the coindesk api which was only really useful for getting the USD price of BTC

-Fixed issues loading site in safari browser (Safari behaves differently than other browsers and seems to require the url prefix to be present when loading external libraries to prevent CORS errors)
-Many blockchains allow you to use addnodes without a port # and it will assume the default port internally, but the explorer was failing to parse these peers because it was expecting a port. This is now fixed and will display the peer data without a port in these cases
-Added support for newer (deterministic) Dash masternode format
-More graceful shutdown of node cluster on 'npm stop' with better cleanup of resources on exit
-Added new stop_explorer.sh script which looks up the explorer port # via settings file and closes the application running on that port # instead of saving and killing the process by pid as it did before
-Added support for pm2 and forever using 'npm run start-pm2' and 'npm run start-forever' respectively
-pm2 is automatically installed when starting with 'npm run start-pm2' if it is not already installed
-forever is automatically installed when starting with 'npm run start-forever' if it is not already installed

-All pages (including the reward and error pages) were updated to include options for displaying a configurable page header with title, image, description and in some cases a last updated date
-The error page was restructured slightly to display a different description based on the type of error (page not found error vs problem loading page error)
-Added new setting options to the `shared_pages` setting for `page_title_image` which allows changing the page title image displayed on applicable pages and also determines whether it uses a flip/spin animation or not
-Added a collection of new `page_header` settings to all pages that control displaying the new page title + image + description and also moved the last updated date from applicable pages into this section as well
-Existing `show_last_updated` settings that were moved a level deeper into the `page_header` have been automatically mapped to the new setting location upon statup to help older installs to work better out-of-the-box
-Locale strings now support replacement text such as {1} and {2} that get automatically replaced with proper values when loaded to allow for locale strings that support dynamic text
-Fixed an issue with too much empty space in the page header (especially in mobile and tablet modes) when `show_panels` was set to false on any page
-Removed unused css class 'loading'
